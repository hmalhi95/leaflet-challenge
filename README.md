# Leaflet Challenge

## Create the Earthquake Visualization
- I first retrieved the GeoJSON data from USGS Data Feed for earthquakes over the last 7 days
- Next, I created a map using OSM to plot all the data I retrieved
- From the GeoJSON data, I added markers to the map I created to show the magnitude via the size of the marker as well as depth by the color of the marker
- I also added popups to provide additional information pertaining to the earthquake such as location that is accessible by clicking on the marker
- Lastly, I added a legend that provides information in regards to what each color of the marker is depicting
